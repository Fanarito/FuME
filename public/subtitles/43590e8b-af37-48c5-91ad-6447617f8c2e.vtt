00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.039
<i>Start talking.</i>

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.799
<i>I'm not sure if we're on the air.</i>

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.919
<i>This is a series of explosions...</i>

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.919
<i>We're being told this
is a major incident.</i>

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.999
<i>The emergency is a major incident.</i>

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.719
<i>...bright lights and an orange glow.</i>

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.759
<i>That was the moment the meteor hit.</i>

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.839
<i>It does now appear to
be a major attack.</i>

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.959
<i>Since they landed outside
Hamburg five years ago...</i>

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.359
<i>they have steadily advanced across Europe.
We've suffered millions of casualties.</i>

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.279
<i>The evacuation of key
government officials continuing.</i>

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.119
<i>Nothing has stopped their advance.</i>

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.439
<i>In human costs, the Europeans
have paid the highest price.</i>

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.959
<i>They have the ability to mimic
and even anticipate our actions.</i>

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.999
<i>If we do not defeat
them in France...</i>

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.299
<i>we'll be fighting them in London
then New York, then Tokyo.</i>

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.159
<i>All of humanity's at stake.</i>

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.679
<i>After five years we
finally have a victory.</i>

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.239
<i>These pictures are
just in from Verdun.</i>

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.519
<i>One of the striking things was
how low casualties were...</i>

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.359
<i>and how little damage...</i>

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.103
<i>We have seen a stunning
victory here today.</i>

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.679
<i>How do you convince people that
this is a fight that can be won?</i>

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.759
<i>This is an alien invasion
in a global war.</i>

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.399
<i>With the new jacket technology
and limited training...</i>

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.189
<i>we've been able to
create super-soldiers.</i>

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.599
<i>Look at Rita Vrataski,
the Angel of Verdun.</i>

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.319
<i>They're calling her
the Angel of Verdun.</i>

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.839
<i>She is seen as the new
hope for this war.</i>

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.279
<i>It's extraordinary.</i>

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.759
<i>With the new jacket technology
and limited training...</i>

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.999
<i>Rita Vrataski was able to kill...</i>

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.039
<i>hundreds of mimics on
only her first day.</i>

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.279
<i>Is the tide of this war changing?</i>

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.719
<i>The Army attribute this success to
a revolutionary new technology:</i>

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.619
<i>The Exosuit jacket.</i>

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.319
<i>She was able to kill hundreds of
mimics on only her first day in combat.</i>

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.919
<i>Imagine an army of Rita Vrataskis.</i>

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.879
<i>We're holding them back at the
English Channel, but for how long?</i>

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.479
<i>This is dangerous talk. People are
suspicious about this invasion.</i>

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.079
<i>Over 17 nations have joined
the United Defense Force...</i>

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.439
<i>which hopes to push them back.
We've got them contained.</i>

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.479
<i>And with this new technology,
we're gonna defeat them.</i>

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.479
<i>Operation Downfall is going to be the
largest mechanized invasion in history.</i>

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.907
<i>We will be victorious. We fight.
That's what we do.</i>

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.799
Major William Cage,
United States Military Media.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.031
Welcome to London, major.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.389
The general will see you now.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.621
Thank you.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.519
<i>Operation Downfall.</i>

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.759
The entire UDF, invading from France,
the Mediterranean, Scandinavia...

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.839
relieving pressure on
the eastern front...

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.399
allowing the Russians and
Chinese to push the enemy back.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.959
We all meet in the middle exterminating
this mimic scourge along the way.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.479
A lot of good soldiers are
gonna die tomorrow, major.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.079
When all the smoke clears...

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.719
and the body bags start coming home,
people look for someone to blame...

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.599
someone like me.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.799
Ideally, I'd prefer a
different scenario.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.303
Please.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.266
A best-selling memoir, perhaps.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.345
Maybe a career in politics?

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.359
Off the top of my head, I would go
with the sense of manifest destiny.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.639
Rags to riches. Rapid
rise through the ranks.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.759
Born to deliver us. And the people,
well, they love that sort of thing.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.039
You misunderstand. I didn't ask you
here to sell me. Sell the invasion.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.199
Okay.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.679
You ship for the coast in one hour.
Your camera crew is standing by.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.503
You'll be on the beach
with the first wave.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.199
I'm sorry, the first wave?
The beach? You mean the front?

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.799
France.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.639
Satellites show minimal enemy
movement on the coast.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.239
Little resistance.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.239
A little excitement, something
to tell your grandchildren.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.639
While I appreciate the
confidence, general...

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.099
I do this to avoid doing that.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.039
I was in ROTC in college.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.119
The war broke out,
I lost my advertising firm...

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.359
and here I am.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.070
You know, I do what I do,
and you do what you do.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.839
But...

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.983
I'm not a soldier, really.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.639
No, of course you're not.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.146
I'm embedding you with several
hundred thousand who are.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.639
While it is an honor, I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to decline.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.819
Can't stand the sight of blood.
Not so much as a paper cut.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.839
Uh, but, uh...

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.559
sitting here thinking about this...

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.759
a couple of names come to mind...

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.959
that I feel I could
recommend to you.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.908
It's not an offer,
major. It's an order.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.959
General, I am an officer in
the United States military.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.279
- You don't even have the authority.
- I have spoken to your CO.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.591
You are now under my command.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.879
You will retain your
present rank of course.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.111
My secretary has all the details.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.550
Do a good job, major.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.147
Good luck. You are dismissed.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.146
General?

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.865
I just inspired millions of
people to join your army.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.839
And when the body bags come
home and they're looking...

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.599
for someone to blame, how hard
do you think it would be...

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.583
for me to convince
people to blame you?

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.585
I'd imagine the general
would prefer to avoid that.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.865
Are you blackmailing me, major?

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.359
I would prefer...

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:23.265
not to be filming acts of heroism
and valor on that beach tomorrow.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.311
You won't be.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.279
I'm glad we could,
uh, work this out.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.909
Now if you'll excuse me,
general. I...

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.419
Thank you.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.066
Arrest this man.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.188
What?

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.199
Hey! Hey!

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.559
Stop right there!

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.519
Hey! Stop!

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.119
Get out of the way!

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.079
Out of the way!

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.469
Hold it!

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.719
Left flank, march!

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.145
Forward, march!

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.539
About-turn!

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.348
<i>Supplies closing in 10 minutes.</i>

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.229
On your feet maggot!

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.559
That is no way to address
an officer, sergeant.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.839
It's how I address a slack-jawed
recruit before I bust his hole

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.559
with my boot heel, maggot.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.985
Hold up there, sergeant.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.065
Can I help you, sir?

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.439
Where the hell am I, sergeant?

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.239
Forward Operating Base Heathrow.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.769
You just came in with
the fresh recruits.

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:16.051
Do I strike you as a fresh recruit?

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.039
No, sir, you do not.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.559
My name is Major William Cage.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.439
- I'm an American officer.
- Officer?

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.519
This is processing.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.548
There's no officers here.
I got this, sergeant.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:30.439
How the hell did you
end up in processing?

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.799
What was it? Poker night?
Bachelor party?

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.919
If it's all the same
to you, sergeant...

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.959
I'd like to explain that to my
commanding officer in Washington.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.639
- If you'll take me to a phone...
- Haven't you heard?

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.719
We're T-minus-Haul-Ass-H-Hour.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.839
We're fixing to invade France.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:51.426
This whole FOB's on lockdown.
No calls, in or out.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.661
- Name is Farell.
- That's right.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.039
Master Sergeant Farell.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.399
You're an American.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.189
No, sir. I'm from Kentucky.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.199
Okay. Well, look at me.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.750
And look at where I am.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.905
I've been railroaded.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.346
It's obvious I don't belong here.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:19.305
So please, sergeant, there has to
be a way I can make a phone call.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.839
I'll get you sorted out, sir.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.822
- Thank you.
- Right this way.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.639
Where you from in Kentucky?

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.879
Little town called
Science Hill. Heard of it?

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:38.959
I have now.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.199
- Where you from?
- Cranbury, New Jersey.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.999
They grow a lot of
cranberries there?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.719
Tomatoes. Best you ever had.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.679
Why they call it Cranberry, then?

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.319
Why they call it Science Hill?

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.984
Never asked. Don't care.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.221
After you.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.159
You're not taking me
to a phone, are you?

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.359
No, I am not.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:08.901
Seems about the only honest thing
you said to me so far is your name.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.391
Says here you're a deserter.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.039
It says here you were caught
impersonating an officer. It says here...

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:20.079
you'd likely try to make an outside call,
compromise security of this operation.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.839
Anything to get out of
combat duty tomorrow.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.079
But that's not gonna happen.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.439
Ever.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.830
Private Cage.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.039
<i>Take you down to the early days</i>

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.399
<i>When the champagne</i>

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.239
<i>Flow like a river stream</i>

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.839
Rumor is a terrible thing.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:45.159
Come nightfall, these men will
all reach the same conclusion.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.399
That you're a coward and a liar,
putting your life above theirs.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.999
Good news is there's
hope for you, private.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.039
Hope in the form of glorious combat.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.839
Battle is the great redeemer.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.319
The fiery crucible in which the
only true heroes are forged.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.199
The one place where all men
truly share the same rank...

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.099
regardless of what kind of
parasitic scum they were going in.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.879
Squad! This here is Private Cage.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.359
Private Cage, J Squad.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.421
Isn't that an officer's uniform?

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.141
Those sure ain't officer cufflinks.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:23.439
I see everyone is having
a productive morning.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:27.719
You know, it gives me a swell of
pride knowing soldiers of your...

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.599
caliber will be leading
the charge tomorrow.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.479
Tip of the spear.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.519
Edge of the knife.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:35.639
Crack of my...

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.039
ass.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.599
Oh, shit.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.159
Private Kimmel, what is
my view of gambling...

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.239
- ...in the barracks?
- You dislike it, Sergeant Farell.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.719
Nance, why do I dislike it?

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.039
It entertains the notion our fate
is in hands other than our own.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.999
And what is my definitive position
on the concept of fate, chorus?

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.382
Through readiness and discipline,
we are masters of our fate.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.439
You might call that notion ironic.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:04.150
But trust me, you'll come around.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.184
Private Cage is a deserter.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.839
I'm making you all personally
responsible for his deliverance.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.319
He will be combat ready
at 0600 tomorrow.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.319
Combat ready?

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.239
Cage is under the delusion
he does not belong here.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.079
We must dissuade him
of this delusion.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:24.959
If he tries to run, feel free to dissuade
him until he can't piss standing up.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.319
You have to listen to me.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.519
- I will never be combat ready.
- I envy you, Cage.

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.981
Tomorrow morning, you will
be baptized. Born again.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.622
PT! Ten minutes!

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:38.719
<i>So everybody</i>

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.839
<i>Come along with me</i>

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.239
<i>Go down the river
And wash your feet</i>

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.479
<i>To where the people
Live a life that's sweet</i>

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.039
<i>And a place that's ripe</i>

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:51.586
You're not in uniform... private.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.039
<i>Could all combat-ready
squadrons proceed...?</i>

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.799
It's a new day, people.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.439
Destiny calls.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:07.139
The world expects only one
thing from us: That we will win.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.430
Come on, Kimmel, let's have it!

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.799
Oh, for chrissake, Kimmel.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.668
I got to be free, man.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.661
Let's get this show on
the road. I gotta suit up.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.879
What's that noise? That...

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.079
Let's go.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.359
Listen, I've never
been in one of these.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.559
I've never been with two
girls at the same time.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.827
You can bet when that day
comes, I'll make it work.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.319
Kimmel.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.599
It's Griff.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:19.959
Griff. Griff. You bet.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:24.159
Just think about this, man.
I could hurt somebody with it.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.425
Not with the safety on, you won't.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.719
But...

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.226
- Where is the safety?
- Exactly.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.980
It's time.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:12.826
Bloody hell, it's the Full Metal...

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.146
Move.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.279
- Griff.
- Sarge?

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:20.239
- Take care of Private Cage.
- What, all day?

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:23.347
Something tells me it won't
be nearly that long.

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.239
- Cage!

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.187
- Cage!
- Cage!

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:32.679
We lost Germany.

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.359
We lost France.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.879
If we lose today we won't
get to fight another.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.199
I know the pressure
on you is enormous.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.159
Two minutes to drop.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.999
It's all right to be scared.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.506
Remember, there's no
courage without fear.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.719
Oi!

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:55.479
Oi, mate! I think there's
something wrong with your suit.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:58.259
Yeah. There's a dead guy in it.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.439
Hey, watch your back out there, sir.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.580
No one else will.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.319
One minute!

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.949
One minute to drop!

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.759
Hey.

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.503
- Hey!
- What?

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.239
How do I turn the safety
off of my weapon?

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.339
What?

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.639
How do I turn the safety off...?

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.541
Oh, my God!

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:37.319
Get ready! Thirty seconds to drop!

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.399
On my mark!

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.079
Stand by to deploy!

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.869
Activate drop lines. Remember...

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.070
Aah! Aah!

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.439
Drop now!

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.679
Let's drop! Drop!

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.502
Drop!

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.519
Drop!

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.679
Go!

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:58.479
Go, let's go!

00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.949
Come on!

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.479
Drop!

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:02.983
Drop!

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.545
Cage! Drop or die!

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.439
Yeah! Whoo!

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.399
We made it!

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.381
Thank God, we made it!

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.227
<i>Select language.</i>

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.919
<i>We need help!</i>

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.419
<i>We need it now!</i>

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:07.671
What the...?

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.999
Private Cage!

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.599
You're going the wrong way.

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.039
You're gonna miss your moment.

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.959
What the hell?

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.239
They're not supposed
to know we're coming.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.239
We walked into a
slaughterhouse, man.

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:32.948
It's a slaughterhouse!

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:34.719
Pull yourself together!

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.270
On your feet, people!

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.719
Get in line!

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.439
Nance, get me a sitrep.

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:43.479
- Safety! My safety!
- Griff, Ford, cover the flank!

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:47.748
My safety. My safety.
How do I get my safety...?

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.559
- I'm waiting, Nance!
- I got traces!

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:52.919
Five hundred meters and
they're coming in fast!

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:54.439
Son of a bitch.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.279
Out of the way!

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:59.039
Look alive if you
wanna stay that way!

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.799
Firing positions!

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.099
Move!

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.519
Here they come.

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.919
Mean as hell and thick as grass.

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.679
Wait till they're right on us!

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.308
Few more seconds!

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:13.559
Hey!

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.222
Hey!

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.427
Fall back!

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:06.599
Ha!

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.659
Ha-ha!

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.187
Reload.

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:01.868
On your feet maggot!

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:09.079
Get in line before I bust your
hole with my boot heel, maggot!

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.584
Hold up there, sergeant.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.670
Can I help you, sir?

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.350
Sergeant Farell. Is it...?

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.470
That is my name.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.519
I think I get it.

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:29.999
What was it? Poker night?
Bachelor party?

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.061
You know, I'm not sure.

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.702
It happens.

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.987
I'll get you sorted out, sir.

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:41.062
Let me take those for you.

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.790
What day is it?

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.906
For you?

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.919
Judgment Day.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.479
The good news is there's
hope for you, private.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.959
Hope in the form of glorious combat.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:57.079
Battle is the great redeemer.

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:58.759
The fiery crucible in which...

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:02.861
- ...the only true heroes are...
- The only true heroes are forged.

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.948
Did you just interrupt me, private?

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.861
Sarge, you're...

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.479
You're not gonna believe
what I'm about to tell you.

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.347
No, I'm not.

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:20.304
Now, where was I?

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.027
The fiery crucible.

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:27.559
The fiery crucible in which the
only true heroes are forged.

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.519
<i>The one place where all
men truly share...</i>

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:33.779
the same rank, regardless of what kind
of parasitic scum they were going in.

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.079
- Welcome to hell.
- Squad!

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:40.586
This here is Private Cage.

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:42.919
Private Cage...

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.759
J Squad.

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.279
Isn't that an officer's uniform?

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.359
They sure ain't officer cufflinks.

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:52.959
You know, it gives me a swell of pride
knowing soldiers of your caliber...

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.039
will be leading the charge tomorrow.

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:58.039
Tip of the spear, edge of the knife.

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.479
Crack of my ass.

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:04.039
Private Kimmel, what is my view
of gambling in the barracks?

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.799
- Dislike it, sergeant.
- Nance, why do I dislike it?

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:10.119
It entertains the notion our fate
is in hands other than our own.

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:14.759
And what is my definitive position
on the concept of fate, chorus?

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:18.664
Through readiness and discipline,
we are masters of our fate.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.719
You might call that notion ironic.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.559
Trust me, you'll come around.

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:27.719
Oh, for chrissake, Kimmel.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.359
- I gotta be free, man.
- All right, man.

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.830
Let's get this show on
the road. I gotta suit up.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.067
<i>Disengaged.</i>

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.559
Hey, what the hell's wrong with you?

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.224
Haven't you ever been
in one of these before?

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.271
Maybe.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.460
Know where the safety is?

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:53.180
- I'm not sure.
- Good.

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:56.999
I know the pressure
on you is enormous.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.119
Two minutes to drop.

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.879
It's all right to be scared.

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.999
There's no courage without fear.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.359
Oi!

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:06.759
Oi, mate!

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:09.359
I think there's something
wrong with your suit.

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.339
Yeah. There's a dead guy in it.

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:17.679
Watch your back out there sir.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.799
- No one else will.
- No one else will.

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.099
Ha-ha! Jinx, bitch!

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:31.279
On my mark! Stand by to deploy!

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:33.879
Activate drop lines, 30 seconds.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.861
- Remember, hit...
- Hey!

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.667
Go! Go!

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.279
Whoo-hoo!

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.559
We made it!

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.586
Behind you!

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.501
Look out!

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.302
Incoming!

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:58.559
I'm hit.

00:29:58.560 --> 00:29:59.949
I'm hit.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.827
How bad is it?

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:07.026
Is there a lot of blood?

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:10.422
You have a hole in your chest.

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:11.519
Really?

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.421
Yeah.

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.279
Did you just take my...?

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:22.261
My battery?

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:27.319
No, no, no. Holy fu...

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:29.426
Aah!

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:35.399
On your feet maggot!

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.999
Sergeant Farell!

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.839
Sergeant Farell.

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:40.079
Can I help you, sir?

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:43.079
My name is Major Bill Cage.
I'm U.S. Army Media Relations.

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.799
I was not at a bachelor
party or a poker game.

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:48.479
You have an order that says I'm a
deserter caught impersonating an officer.

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.159
But what it doesn't say is...

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.879
your name is Master Sergeant
Farell from Science Hill, Kentucky.

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:55.780
If you give me 30 seconds
to explain how I know that,

00:30:55.781 --> 00:30:59.991
you may save the lives of
every soldier on this base.

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:04.719
You have to listen to me! They know
we're coming! They're waiting for us!

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:07.399
I have been there! I've seen it!

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:09.879
You're all doomed! You're doomed!

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:13.919
Okay. Okay. Okay,
I'm fine. I'm fine.

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:15.439
This is J Squad. Yes?

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.959
This is J Squad, yes.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.199
Not that I should
know that, but okay.

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.519
Have any of you met me before?

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:22.839
Bitch, I don't know you.

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.719
Exactly! Yes!

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:25.759
Thank you.

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:27.119
Your name is Nance. You're Bibble.

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:31.119
Kibble... Kimmel!
You fight balls out. Literally.

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:33.679
Ford. Skinner. Griff.

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.627
You're...

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.919
He doesn't talk much.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.499
- But there's a card game under the bed.
- Thanks a lot, asshole.

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:45.028
Kimmel's working on a flush.
Spades... No, clubs.

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:48.319
You're gonna make
them eat those cards.

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.710
Am I right?

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.261
Now...

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:59.302
what I'm about to tell
you sounds crazy.

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:01.301
It's true.

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:04.742
And you have to listen to me.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.461
Your very lives depend on it.

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.461
One minute!

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:26.619
What? What is he saying?
Nance! What is he saying?

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.626
On my mark! Stand by to deploy!

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:43.509
The ship is about to explode!

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.639
Yeah! Whoo!

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.439
We made it!

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.148
Thank God, we made it!

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:01.119
Aah!

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:03.640
...before I bust your
hole with my boot heel!

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.519
Yeah! Whoo!

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:07.439
We made it!

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:09.148
Thank God, we made it!

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:27.748
Aah!

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.519
I'm sorry. I'm trying to save you.

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:43.224
We're getting slaughtered.
You need to get us off this beach.

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:51.639
We have to go. This drop
ship is about to explode.

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.599
We have to go now.

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.467
Wait.

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.142
Come on!

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.787
Come on!

00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:18.959
Come on!

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.271
This ship is going to explode!

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.759
What are you doing?

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:26.025
Find me when you wake up.

00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:26.999
What?

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.026
Come find me when you wake up.

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:31.959
Aah!

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:34.781
On your feet maggot!

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:40.839
Get in line before I bust
your hole with my boot heel!

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:43.119
Good news is there's
hope for you, private.

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:44.599
Battle is the great redeemer.

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:47.679
The fiery crucible in which the
only true heroes are forged.

00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:50.779
The one place where
all men truly sh...

00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:57.959
Squad, this here is...

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:00.639
Private Cage.
And you must be J Squad.

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:01.879
It's good to meet you.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.639
Isn't that an officer's uniform?

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:07.631
- Those sure...
- These sure ain't officer's cufflinks.

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:13.908
Keys in the... left
pocket, probably.

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:19.839
Private Cage is a deserter.

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:23.599
I'm making you all personally
responsible for his deliverance.

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:27.439
He will be combat ready
by 0600 tomorrow.

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:30.279
Private Cage is under the
delusion he does not belong here.

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.159
We must dissuade him
of this delusion.

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:36.587
- If he tries to run, feel free to dissuade him...
- Oh, no. I'm not gonna run.

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.879
- Not a chance.
- Till he can't piss standing up.

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:41.350
Thank you, Sergeant Farell.

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:55.679
What next? A little, uh, PT?

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:58.119
PT! Ten minutes!

00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:02.199
Left! Left! Left!

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:05.079
- What are you? Sound off!
- I'm a warrior!

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.999
- What do warriors do?
- Kill!

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.399
- What are you gonna do?
- Kill!

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:10.999
- What are you gonna do?
- Kill!

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.199
It's gonna be my 20th
battle tomorrow.

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:15.799
- You haven't been in 20 battles, mate.
- I have too.

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:18.759
You're gonna dump your load
the second we hit the beach.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:21.439
Why don't you get yourselves
a cup of shut-the-hell-up?

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.999
Ha-ha. You funny, girl.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.719
I bet I set a record tomorrow.

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:29.119
Fastest time running backwards,
Ford, slipping in your own shit.

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:31.799
Knock off the grab-ass!

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:32.959
Grab this, sarge!

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:34.861
Hold up!

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:39.861
Private, drop and give me...

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:42.741
Fifty, sarge?

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:44.919
That's right.

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:46.599
Fifty.

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:48.308
Platoon!

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.222
Drop and give me 50!

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:52.319
Compliments of Private Cage.

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:54.559
Thank you, sarge.

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:56.439
- And one!
- One!

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:57.679
- And two!
- Two!

00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.581
- And three!
- Three!

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:07.469
- Aah!
- Oh!

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:11.599
What the hell were you thinking?

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:15.239
There's hope for you, private.
Hope in the form of glorious combat.

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:17.999
Battle is the great redeemer.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.759
- Three!
- Three!

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.399
- Four!
- Four!

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:23.825
- Five!
- Five!

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:09.386
Excuse me. Sergeant Vrataski.

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:13.308
Excuse me.

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:16.625
Sergeant Vrataski?

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:36.559
Excuse me.

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:38.871
Yes? Who said you could talk to me?

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:41.919
Have I got something on my face?

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:43.799
You did. You did.

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.839
Tomorrow. At the beach.

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:48.504
Tomorrow. At the beach.

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.862
We meet.

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:54.471
You said to find you when I wake up.

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:59.159
You do know what's happening to me.

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:01.199
Come with me.

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.679
Now.

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:05.639
You don't talk to anyone
about this but me.

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:08.759
The best-case scenario is you're
gonna end up in a psych ward.

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:12.239
Worst case, you'll get dissected
for study. Are we clear?

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:13.679
- Yes?
- Yes.

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:15.599
First time you died, what happened?

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.159
- You killed a mimic?
- Yes.

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:19.879
- Describe it.
- It was different.

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:22.879
It was bigger. Bluish.

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:25.639
And you got covered in its blood.

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.839
As a matter of fact, I did.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.599
They know we're coming
on the beach tomorrow.

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:33.279
It's a slaughter, isn't it?

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:36.039
How do you know this?

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:37.639
Could you just...? Wait!

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:40.119
Wait. Wait.

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:43.239
Would you explain to me
what the hell is happening.

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:45.679
What happened to you happened to me.

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:48.079
I had it. I lost it. Okay?

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.839
That's great. There's a cure.
How do I get rid of this?

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.479
First, I need your help.

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:55.701
Help with what exactly?

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:57.919
Winning the war.

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.060
Let's go! Come on!

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:38.399
Rita, what is this?

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:41.199
What are you doing here?
You gotta give me some warning.

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:44.479
- Who's this?
- He's me. Before Verdun.

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:46.825
He's gonna help us.

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:52.119
What? You mean he's...?

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:54.021
Yes.

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:56.959
When did he die? Where?

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.827
On the beach. Tomorrow.

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:02.959
How many fingers am I
holding up behind my back?

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:05.191
How should I know that?

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:06.719
Okay.

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:10.719
So this is the first time
we've had this conversation.

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:13.159
- You should try this on him.
- What is that?

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:15.391
It doesn't work.

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.119
Has he had any visions yet?

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.319
Visions of what?

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:19.519
There's still time.

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:21.479
- Yes.
- Time? Look, I'm sorry.

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:24.064
Who is this? Who are you?

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:28.119
I'm Dr. Carter. Particle physics.
Advanced microbiology.

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:31.639
He's also the only other person who'll
believe what's happening to you.

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:33.919
No one understands mimic
biology better than him.

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:35.719
He's a top analyst at Whitehall.

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:39.079
Well, I mean, I was until I
met Rita and now I'm just...

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:41.439
a "mechanic with
psychiatric delusions."

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.639
Carter.

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:44.519
Show him.

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:46.706
Yeah, right.

00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:54.719
Right. Well, first of all...

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:55.999
you're not fighting an army.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.999
You have to think of this
as a single organism.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.039
Now, these common drones,
they act like its claws.

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:07.079
And Alphas, like the one that
you killed, are much more rare.

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:08.479
Yeah. They're like one in...

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.159
- ...6.18 million, by my guess.
- Yes.

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:11.879
They act as the enemy's...

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:13.639
They're like its central
nervous system.

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:15.439
But this...

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.479
is the brain.

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:21.679
It controls them all.
And this is the Omega.

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:26.099
And the Omega has the
ability to control time.

00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:28.799
Whenever an Alpha is killed...

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:31.519
an automatic response is triggered.

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:34.319
The Omega starts the day over again.

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:39.519
But you see, this time, it can remember
what's going to happen just like you do.

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:42.759
It knows exactly what we're gonna
do before we're gonna do it.

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:46.311
- And an enemy that knows the future can't lose.
- It can't lose.

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:50.399
But if that's true, how
did you win at Verdun?

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.559
We were allowed to win.

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:55.599
This thing wants us to
believe we can win.

00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:58.919
It wants us to throw everything
we have into the invasion.

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:03.919
Operation Downfall isn't our
endgame it's the enemy's.

00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:08.399
The thing you've got to understand
is this is a perfectly evolved...

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:11.587
world-conquering organism.

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:14.679
For all we know, there are
millions of those asteroids...

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:17.639
floating around in the
cosmos like a virus.

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:21.599
They're just waiting to crash-land into
a world with just the right conditions.

00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:25.839
All they need is for the dominant
life form to attack and:

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:27.719
There'll be nothing
to stop the mimics...

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:30.159
from conquering the
rest of the world.

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:33.062
Unless you change the outcome.

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:35.039
Me?

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:37.959
When you killed that Alpha, you inadvertently
entered the enemy's nervous system.

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:43.586
Cage, you've seized control of the
Omega's ability to reset the day.

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:46.759
- How's that even possible?
- Perhaps this organism's...

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:49.879
only vulnerability,
its only vulnerability...

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:51.119
is humanity.

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:54.959
Regardless of that,
you control the power now.

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:57.679
Just as I did in Verdun.

00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.820
So I'm resetting the day?

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:03.786
Okay.

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:05.701
How do I control it?

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:10.519
You have to die.

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:12.039
Every day.

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:14.942
Until the Omega's destroyed.

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.479
First of all...

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:30.679
this is a terrific presentation.

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:33.105
Terrific.

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:34.959
I know the general.

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:37.519
We should take this to him.

00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:41.639
- You just tell him everything you told me.
- I went to see the general.

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:44.383
Any number of times.

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:48.184
Psych ward. Dissection. Remember?

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:53.746
What are you expecting from me?

00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:58.304
Have you seen anything strange?

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:00.199
Is he shitting me?

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:01.279
Visions.

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:04.387
Visions. Have you seen
any visions like that?

00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:07.932
The Omega senses when it's
losing control of its power.

00:45:07.933 --> 00:45:10.319
Even now it's mentally
searching to find you.

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:13.970
When it's close to finding you
you will start having visions.

00:45:13.971 --> 00:45:18.587
- You'll start to see that.
- You'll even see where it is.

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:21.279
And you had these visions?

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:23.306
Yes.

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:28.679
But eventually you saw it.
I mean, you actually saw it.

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:30.706
Right?

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:34.347
Never in the flesh.

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:41.342
So this is all just some...

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:43.359
theory.

00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:46.159
You don't know if this
thing even exists.

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:50.621
The visions showed me it was
at Verdun. I could see it. I...

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.159
I just...

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:55.461
lost the power before
I could get to it.

00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:59.061
And by the time we took Verdun...

00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:02.262
the Omega was gone.

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:08.439
Okay. So all I have to do is...
wait to have these visions...

00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:12.239
and then tell you where
this Omega thing is.

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:14.399
No. Cage.

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:19.026
You're gonna get me there.
And I'm gonna kill it.

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:21.586
Get you there?

00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:25.742
I'm not even trained for combat.

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:42.383
<i>Reload.</i>

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:44.745
<i>Reload.</i>

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:05.159
Are you all right, Cage?

00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:06.879
I think I broke something.

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:08.959
What?

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:11.021
My back.

00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:14.479
The only thing I can
feel are my lips.

00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:17.667
Now listen carefully. This
is a very important rule.

00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:20.199
This is the only rule.

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:24.024
You get injured on the field,
you better make sure you die.

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:25.119
Why?

00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:27.239
Last time I was in combat...

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:28.919
I was hit.

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:32.519
I was bleeding out.
Just not fast enough.

00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:33.999
I woke up in a field hospital...

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.382
with three pints of someone
else's blood and I was out.

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:42.239
I lost the power. Do you understand?

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:43.719
Think we better start over.

00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:45.587
- Don't you?
- What?

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.061
Aah!

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:51.919
No one knows what
happened to Private Cage!

00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:53.839
You dumb-ass. He was
right next to you.

00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:56.559
You don't know where that
slippery son of a bitch went?

00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:58.119
No, sarge!

00:47:58.120 --> 00:47:59.839
All right.

00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:02.119
Let's do another 50, shall we?

00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:03.559
And one!

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:05.679
No, wait! Wait.
My name is Bill Cage.

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:09.159
I... We met on the beach.
We meet on the beach. Tomorrow.

00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:11.186
I have what you had.

00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:18.382
Ugh. All right, let's go again.

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:24.719
You don't have time
to think. Remember.

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:26.879
It's not enough knowing
where they're going to be.

00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:30.021
You have to know how to kill them.

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:38.262
Hold on. Hold on. Listen. List...

00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:40.261
Okay. Do it.

00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:42.479
Unh!

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:44.063
On your feet, maggot!

00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:50.119
Stop! Wait! Wait, wait, wait!

00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:52.039
Stop! Wait! Wait a second!

00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:55.466
Wait a sec. Wait a second.

00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.439
You know, I've been thinking.

00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:00.999
I mean, this thing's in my blood.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.079
So maybe there's some way...
I can transfer it to you.

00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:07.319
I've tried everything.
It doesn't work.

00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:09.679
I mean, have you...

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:11.581
you know...

00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:15.119
tried all the options?

00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:18.022
Oh, you mean sex. Yep. Tried it.

00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:19.439
How many times?

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:21.148
All right.

00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:23.599
Left.

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:25.103
Left! Left, left!

00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:30.541
Keep your eyes open.

00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:34.463
Again.

00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:35.989
Again.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.423
Again.

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:41.422
Again.

00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:48.879
Just wait! Wait.

00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:50.119
I think I'm okay.

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:52.146
Unh!

00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:53.319
On your feet!

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:54.839
Maggot! Maggot!

00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:57.822
I'm trying to be nice
to you, maggot! Move!

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:00.999
You okay, Cage?

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.839
Oh yeah, yeah! I'm good! I'm good!

00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:04.079
Your leg's broken.

00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:07.221
No. I can still feel my toes.

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:09.820
Oh, come on.

00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:26.265
Aah!

00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:32.519
Rita. Rita. What is this?
What are you doing here?

00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:34.559
- Who's this guy?
- He's me...

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:36.159
- ...before Verdun.
- Before Verdun.

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:37.559
What do you mean? He's...?

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:38.999
- Yes. Yes.
- When did he die?

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.879
- Where?
- On the beach. Tomorrow.

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:42.239
I'm Bill Cage. You're Dr. Carter.

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:44.919
We've had this conversation before.
Two fingers behind your back.

00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:46.759
I've had the visions.

00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:48.786
I've seen the Omega.

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:53.108
Um...

00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:56.759
It's pretty much game over tomorrow.

00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:58.866
So can we move this along?

00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:02.029
Okay. Where?

00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:04.279
There's a dam.

00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:06.239
It's in the mountains.
I saw German writing.

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:08.279
Do you think you can
work out where that is?

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:12.002
I mean, there can't be... too many
places that fit that description.

00:51:12.003 --> 00:51:13.405
I'll see what I can do.

00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:16.679
Training's over.
I'll see you tomorrow.

00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:18.239
We don't even know
where we're going.

00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:19.839
We will soon enough.

00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:24.062
In the meantime, you need to figure
out a way to get us off that beach.

00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:47.559
What next? Where are we going?

00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:49.159
Which way? Focus. Which way?

00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:50.799
- I'm thinking.
- Okay.

00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:52.679
Oh, man!

00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:54.820
How far did we make it?

00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:58.989
You know, it's hard to say, really.

00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:02.119
Hold! Hold!

00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:04.226
Okay, go!

00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:06.439
Son of a bitch!

00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:09.239
I thought stepping left, ducking...
Just for the record.

00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:11.839
- It was pretty specific.
- Stepping left, ducking right.

00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:15.789
Stepping left,
ducking right. Move on.

00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:20.559
Hold on!

00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:23.479
Across the trench, 12:00!

00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:25.541
Then look to your right!

00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:32.919
You're not being specific.

00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:35.982
You need to be specific.
Otherwise, I'm dead.

00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:38.305
Rita.

00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:41.101
Cage!

00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:45.199
Paces up to the top of the trench.
I'm gonna step left.

00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:47.625
A mimic there, which I'll kill.

00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:59.199
...ship explosion. I'm gonna
run 30 paces northwest.

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:03.502
I'm gonna duck at the top of that
trench and then I'm gonna turn left.

00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:14.150
Have I got something on my face?

00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:17.261
No.

00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:26.039
Cage!

00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:28.679
We've been looking
everywhere for you.

00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:30.279
Cage!

00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:33.079
- Cage, we've been looking...
- Guys.

00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:34.719
Guys. Can we...

00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:36.079
just...

00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:37.759
not do this today?

00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:39.559
What are you talking about?

00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:43.508
Farell almost strung us up by our
bollocks for losing track of you.

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:47.590
Okay, Skinner. Watch this.

00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:50.439
Now I'm gonna close my eyes.

00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:52.179
- Ready?
- Yeah.

00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:59.479
Sneaky bastard.

00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:02.269
I didn't mind the extra push-ups.

00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:14.079
It's a new day people.

00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:15.719
Destiny calls.

00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:20.022
The world expects only one
thing from us: that we will win.

00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:37.119
<i>...current situation
on the front line.</i>

00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:39.559
<i>Our troops have suffered
heavy casualties.</i>

00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:42.279
It's about time we showed those
things what we're made of.

00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:44.839
My father flew in
the Battle of Britain.

00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:48.039
Three years before the
Yanks came into the war.

00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:49.879
Couldn't be broken.

00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:51.119
Backbone.

00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:53.439
My Uncle George landed on
the beach at Normandy.

00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:54.719
Yeah?

00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:57.639
In their day, this war would
have been over by now.

00:54:57.640 --> 00:54:59.599
What do they want with us, anyway?

00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:01.639
It's obvious, isn't it? Minerals.

00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:03.479
- Minerals?
- Yeah, minerals. Metals.

00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:04.919
- Oxygen, they want.
- Oxygen?

00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:07.239
- Think about it.
- What difference does it make?

00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:09.599
They're here. They're winning.

00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:12.319
And whatever it is,
they're gonna get it.

00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:15.319
Shouldn't you be over there?

00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:17.267
I've been over there.

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.719
More times than anybody.

00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:24.625
As a matter of fact,
I'm usually long dead by now.

00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:28.381
Coward.

00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:32.199
What's going on?

00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:34.340
The power's gone.

00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:43.159
I found the Omega.

00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:46.199
I found it. It has to be here.
Curnera Dam, Germany.

00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:49.399
- This has got to be it. It fits the description.
- You found it.

00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:51.159
Again.

00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:53.279
What difference does it make?

00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:55.830
Because we're never gonna get there.

00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:58.221
No matter what we do...

00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:01.719
no matter how carefully we plan...

00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:04.622
we can't get off that beach.

00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:16.799
You can do this. You can.

00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:21.068
You keep coming here every
day and I'll train you.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.345
You already have.

00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:48.039
- I'm waiting, Nance!
- Five hundred meters and closing fast!

00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:50.271
What the...?

00:57:57.880 --> 00:57:59.827
Reload.

00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:13.311
What's next?

00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:17.039
Straight shot up the hill.

00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:19.146
Okay.

00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:21.959
Hey, sarge, the new guy...

00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:24.305
what's his name again?

00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:30.559
We'll need a vehicle
to get further inland.

00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:31.999
What's the problem?

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:35.559
The ambush waiting for us. They kill
us before we find a working car.

00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:37.919
Okay. So, what's the current plan?

00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:39.359
Two cars we haven't tried yet.

00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:42.519
- The minivan and the green SUV.
- Yeah. Okay.

00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:45.679
I'll head for the SUV, draw the
mimics to me. You go for the minivan.

00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:48.759
You get it started, just go,
take off. Do not wait for me.

00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:50.119
Okay.

00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:54.198
Just don't forget to disconnect
the caravan before you take off.

00:58:54.199 --> 00:58:58.831
You are going to be in a hurry,
you don't want any dead weight.

00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:24.659
Come on.

00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:40.781
Come on, Cage!

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:46.559
<i>...casualties. The enemy has
breached security at Dover.</i>

00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:48.507
Can't see.

00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:51.941
Can you?

00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:02.279
<i>Stay where you are and remain calm.</i>

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:07.500
<i>If you are in a vehicle please
lock doors and stay inside.</i>

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:16.279
<i>I'm sorry. The enemy
has reached London.</i>

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:17.879
<i>Repeat:</i>

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:20.145
<i>London is under attack.</i>

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:25.999
Good driving.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.186
I forgot to unhook the trailer.

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:43.542
<i>Engage.</i>

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:16.429
You don't talk much.

01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:18.119
I'm not a fan.

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:19.679
Of talking?

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:22.548
Not a fan of talking. No.

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:26.307
You know you eventually
do talk to me.

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:28.399
It's usually around Lyons.

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:31.399
You tell me about the time you
went there with your family.

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.984
Your brother got lost.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.439
I've never been to Lyons.

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:40.024
You tell me your middle name.

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:42.860
Peyton.

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:47.023
That's not my middle name.

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:54.386
You find your brother in
the arcade, by the way.

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:58.039
Well, maybe I made it all
up just to keep you quiet.

01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.279
But you do talk to me.

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:01.559
Cage, I do not need
to get to know you.

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:04.959
If you knew what was good for you,
you wouldn't want to get to know me.

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:07.999
It's the only way you make
it through this thing.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.879
What about Hendricks?
You get to know him?

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:13.839
- How do you know that name?
- You mentioned him.

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:15.119
That's not possible.

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:16.639
Then how do I know his name?

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:20.020
When did I mention him?
Under what circumstance?

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:23.343
Is he why you won't talk to me?

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:29.461
Don't ever mention his name again.

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:33.665
- Why? Are you... in love with him?
- He's dead.

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:41.039
And I watched him die 300 times
and I remember every detail.

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:45.023
I remember everything.
So I don't need to talk about it.

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:50.879
I'm sorry.

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:53.430
It's just war.

01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:58.502
There's nothing here.
Let's keep going.

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:23.301
We have to find the keys.

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:25.439
Let's just siphon the gas.

01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:29.230
- Why drive when we can fly?
- In that thing?

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:32.839
- Let me guess. You're afraid of heights.
- I'm afraid of crashing.

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:34.759
And not at all ashamed to admit it.

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:38.061
You'll be fine, Cage.
You'll learn. Oh.

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:40.039
What is it?

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:42.079
It's nothing. I'm fine.

01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:43.679
- What is it?
- It's nothing.

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:45.581
Rita.

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:50.986
Let me see.

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:12.399
We have to find the
keys to the helicopter.

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:14.919
I'm sure they're
around here somewhere.

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:19.159
You know, the heli's full of
fuel, though. I found a hose.

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:21.903
We're flying, Cage.

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:28.359
Let's just say we find
the keys. You know?

01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:30.599
Get that helicopter started.

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:32.911
We don't have our
jackets or ammunition.

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:35.584
It's gonna be dark in a few hours.

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:40.719
Might be better off just
going back to the farmhouse.

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:42.479
Seeing what we could salvage.

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:45.799
Spend the night there.
Come back here in the morning.

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:49.226
And curl up by the fire and
open a bottle of wine.

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:54.345
I think we should just reset.

01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:55.519
Whoa!

01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:59.159
It's a dead end. If it's all the
same to you I'm tired. I'm in pain.

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:00.999
- I'd rather just start fresh.
- Tell you what.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.679
Take a few minutes. Coffee's ready.

01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:05.559
I'll look for the keys.
That's productive.

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:07.399
- Ten minutes.
- Okay.

01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:09.381
Then I'm killing you.

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:11.501
Fine.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.026
I can't believe you found coffee.

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:20.101
Thank you.

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:22.461
Oh.

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:24.279
Sugar, right?

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:26.181
Yeah.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.551
- Thank you.
- No, hold on. Three. You like three.

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:51.146
There's a shirt over there.
It should be your size.

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:01.787
How many times have we been here?

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.947
How many times?

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:11.591
Where are the keys?

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:13.991
- Where are the goddamn keys?
- Okay.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.439
You can fly it, can't you?

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:19.999
No. Well, yes.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.759
I mean, I can take off.
I'm still working on my landing.

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:24.799
What are we still doing here?

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:28.067
- You're wasting time!
- Rita, if you start that engine, you die.

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:33.399
This is as far as you go.

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:35.665
No matter what I do...

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:38.982
this is as far as you ever make it.

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:49.439
There's a mimic
buried 20 yards away.

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:52.069
It attacks when you
start the engine.

01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:55.359
Get your weapon and get
in the helicopter, Cage.

01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:58.388
There's more in the
field back there.

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:01.239
Only one of us ever makes it.

01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:02.559
Get in.

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:05.279
Only thing we haven't tried is you
walk away. Go to the farmhouse.

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:06.679
There's a cellar and there's food.

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:09.639
Wait there... till I get back.
You'll be safe.

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:13.079
I'm a soldier. I volunteered.
I'm not walking away.

01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:16.381
You die here. Right here.

01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:19.479
I can't save you.

01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:23.079
And if I go on and kill
the Omega, you're dead.

01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:24.359
Forever.

01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:27.706
Why does it matter
what happens to me?

01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:32.341
I wish...

01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:34.591
I didn't know you.

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:38.191
But I do.

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:11.029
My middle name...

01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:13.790
is Rose.

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:35.230
On your feet, maggot!

01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:47.919
<i>The good news is there's
hope for you, private.</i>

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:51.079
Hope in the form of glorious combat.

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:52.799
Battle is the great redeemer.

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:57.147
The fiery crucible in which the
only true heroes are forged.

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:09.661
Yes?

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:12.783
Who said you could talk to me?

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:18.587
Have I got something
on my face, soldier?

01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:23.909
I'm sorry to disturb you, sergeant.

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:48.382
Let's get this show on
the road. I gotta suit up.

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:52.221
Where's your helmet?

01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:57.469
Never wear one. It's a distraction.

01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:00.359
Have you been drinking?

01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:02.599
I need three more clips of 5.56...

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:06.390
eight grenades and an extra battery.

01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:11.061
Get it.

01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:18.559
Oi!

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:20.279
Oi, mate!

01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:22.750
There's something
wrong with your suit.

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:26.159
There's a dead guy in it.

01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:27.199
Whoo-hoo!

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:28.679
We made it!

01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:31.025
Thank God, we made it!

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:35.066
Finish it!

01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:31.359
- It isn't there.
- What do you mean?

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.279
My guess is it never was.

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:35.959
They knew we were coming.
They ambushed us.

01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:38.350
The visions were a trap.

01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:42.147
Just like Rita's visions
were a trap at Verdun.

01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:45.479
It could have killed me, but it didn't.
It was after my blood.

01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:48.587
So they know who you are. They...

01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:50.719
They want their power back.

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:54.439
They're gonna get it one way or
another. Unless we find the Omega.

01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:56.359
- There isn't any other way. We're finished.
- No.

01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:58.519
We're not finished.

01:15:58.520 --> 01:15:59.839
I can't get it to work.

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:01.519
You built a prototype at Whitehall.

01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:04.119
Yes, and I got fired for it,
thank you very much.

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:06.159
- What is this thing?
- It's a transponder.

01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:09.399
Stick it into the Alpha and it taps into the
wavelength connecting it to the Omega.

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:11.439
That's the idea, anyway.

01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:14.820
I can't get it to work.
Not with the equipment I have.

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:18.359
How do we get what you need?

01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:21.159
That's the thing. When I was
at Whitehall, I built one.

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:22.879
I was even ready to test it.

01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:25.439
When I told my superiors
about it, I lost my job.

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:27.399
They thought he was crazy.

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:29.599
So we need to go to Whitehall.

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:31.992
She'd be arrested 10 feet
from the front door.

01:16:31.993 --> 01:16:35.239
Psych ward, dissection,
remember? Hey, hey, hey.

01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:36.879
Aren't you forgetting something?

01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:39.319
The transponder requires a
live Alpha to make it work.

01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:44.261
We don't need one.
We got the next best thing.

01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:50.350
When the Chinese delegation
comes out we pick up the pace.

01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:53.919
This guy with the yellow armband
always recognizes you...

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:58.188
so just keep your head
down and stay to my right.

01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:06.071
Nicely done.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.439
Three, two, one. Go.

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:12.387
One...

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:15.839
Six, seven...

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:17.741
eight...

01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:20.941
Twelve...

01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:23.879
Fifteen. Now.

01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:26.589
And, turn.

01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:29.668
Okay. Keep walking.
Just stare straight ahead.

01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:32.519
Robinson.

01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:35.439
I've asked not to be disturbed.
This had better be critical.

01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:36.759
The fate of mankind.

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:38.479
Critical enough?

01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:40.239
I don't believe what I'm seeing.

01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:42.719
I've had more than my share of that.

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:45.279
Sit down, general.
Stay away from the desk.

01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:48.864
I'd take her very
seriously if I were you.

01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:51.919
Have to hand it to you, major.

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:54.839
When you left this office today,
I never imagined you'd be back...

01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:57.479
let alone with my most
decorated soldier.

01:17:57.480 --> 01:18:00.039
I'm gonna tell you a story.
It's gonna sound ridiculous.

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:02.421
The longer I talk, the more
rational it's going to appear.

01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:04.079
Tell him you'll call back.

01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:05.879
Tell who?

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:10.068
Major General Beaumont, calling from Halifax.
His plane's just been delayed. Bad weather.

01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:12.261
Yes.

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:17.468
Thank you, Beaumont.
I'll call you back.

01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:20.423
Tomorrow's invasion is a slaughter.

01:18:20.424 --> 01:18:24.719
I'm dead within minutes of landing along
with every other soldier you are sending.

01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:27.439
And that's because the
enemy knows we're coming.

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:29.719
How do I know this? Before I died...

01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:31.999
I killed a mimic, only
this one was different.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.999
It passed something on
to me. In my blood.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.879
Now I live the same day over
and over again. Just like they do.

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:40.679
Just like Sergeant
Vrataski at Verdun.

01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:43.199
Tell your secretary
everything's fine.

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:45.226
Beg your pardon?

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:50.399
Sorry, general.
I thought you were alone.

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:51.239
It's fine.

01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:53.519
She typed up those orders
for you to authorize.

01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:57.580
But she left out the ones referring
to the fuel dump at Greenwich.

01:18:58.640 --> 01:18:59.919
Your name is Iris.

01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:02.399
Your birthday is September 17th.

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:04.079
The general pulled some strings...

01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:07.359
stationed your son in Australia,
as far from the war as possible.

01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:11.309
Tell the general his dinner's been
canceled. The call came in just now.

01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:14.679
Your dinner was canceled.

01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:17.119
You forgot the fuel dump.

01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:18.199
Thank you, Iris.

01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:20.101
That'll be all.

01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:29.679
- Cage, let's go. Come on.
- Rita.

01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:32.879
- Let me... Don't shoot him again.
- What are we doing?

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:35.509
Okay? Just...

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:42.039
General, this isn't the first time
we've had this conversation.

01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:46.069
That's because you're stubborn.

01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:50.199
You won't believe me when I tell
you that Dr. Carter was right.

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:52.119
That the enemy can manipulate time.

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:56.159
The invasion will fail. No matter
how many bodies you throw at it.

01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:58.159
The only way to win this war is...

01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:02.439
by finding this power source of
the mimic horde and killing it.

01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:06.389
And the only means of finding
it is in that safe right there.

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:10.239
No matter how many times
we have this conversation...

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:13.719
you refuse to accept that the enemy
breaks through to London tomorrow...

01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:17.590
and we lose. We lose everything.

01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:26.260
Let's say for one moment...

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:29.225
that I can't rationally explain...

01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:32.390
your impressive parlor tricks.

01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:37.159
Dr. Carter told me...

01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:41.199
this device requires a live mimic
to work. What use is it to you?

01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:43.750
- That's my concern.
- On the contrary.

01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:46.759
According to you, this
concerns the whole world.

01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:50.869
Well, what would you do if you
believed everything I just told you?

01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:53.719
- I would locate this...
- Omega.

01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:55.039
Bomb it out of existence.

01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:59.706
You're not mentally equipped to fight
this thing. And you never will be.

01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:17.830
What do we do now?

01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:21.431
I don't know.
We've never gotten this far.

01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:27.519
That was easy.

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:28.599
Down!

01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:30.759
Stop right there! Don't move!

01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:33.185
Nobody move!

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:35.182
Weapon!

01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:38.061
Stop!

01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:43.279
- They're off and away!
- They're...

01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:47.667
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- Stick it in your leg. Do it!

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:07.705
<i>Cage, what's happening?</i>

01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:09.519
<i>Talk to me.</i>

01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:12.679
<i>I feel it. It's taking me there.</i>

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:14.741
<i>What do you see?</i>

01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:17.279
<i>It's the Louvre.</i>

01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:19.119
<i>Where? Where are you?</i>

01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:21.988
<i>I'm inside now. It's flooded.</i>

01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:26.159
<i>Now I'm going down. I'm in a garage.
A garage underneath the museum.</i>

01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:28.550
<i>The Omega. Can you see it?</i>

01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:35.902
It's in Paris.

01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:54.623
Rita!

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:05.679
Stay in the car!

01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:09.629
- Stay back.
- Move away. Move away.

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:37.639
What have you done?

01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:40.461
What have you done?

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:44.319
You'll be fine.
You just needed blood.

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:47.319
You don't know what
you've just done.

01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:50.386
- I can't talk to you.
- I was with someone.

01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:54.079
Rita Vrataski. Is she alive?

01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:55.999
Rita Vrataski.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.901
Please.

01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:00.106
Just tell me that.

01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:03.759
Please tell me.

01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:05.661
I'm sorry.

01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:46.223
I was out of those things in three
minutes flat. What's wrong with you?

01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:49.279
I thought you were dead.

01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:51.386
Not yet.

01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:57.799
- Sorry, Cage.
- No! Whoa. Wait! Wait!

01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:01.665
I'm out. I'm out.
They gave me blood.

01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:07.351
I lost the power.

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:10.519
I feel it.

01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:13.422
I can't reset the day anymore.

01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:32.063
We have to kill the Omega
before the invasion starts.

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:34.919
That gives us less than three hours.

01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:38.359
We need a drop ship to
get to Paris in time.

01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:40.479
Need more soldiers too.

01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:43.621
Now, who's crazy enough
to follow us to Paris?

01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:50.799
Cage!

01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:52.039
Cage!

01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:54.519
- Guys!
- We've been looking everywhere for you.

01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:56.719
- Just listen.
- Farell almost strung us up...

01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:59.279
- ...for losing track of you.
- I know. Just listen.

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:00.879
You're gonna wanna hear this.

01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:02.759
It's gonna sound
ridiculous at first.

01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:05.679
The longer I talk, the more
rational it's going to appear.

01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:06.839
Yeah?

01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:09.039
He named the school I went to.

01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:13.519
And then he tells me my second
grade teacher was called Miss Polio.

01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:16.279
She wouldn't let him go to the
bathroom made him wet his pants.

01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:17.919
Shut up.

01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:20.359
Look, I am telling you, man.

01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:22.039
He knows everything.

01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:23.159
About all of us.

01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:25.359
- Bullshit.
- Yeah?

01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:28.547
He says your name ain't really Ford.

01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:30.479
Says Ford was your friend.

01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:33.239
Died in combat on his first day.

01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:35.599
You took his place. Send
your checks to his family.

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:37.999
You slippery bitch.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.559
Cage says the enemy knows us too.
They're waiting for us on the beach.

01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:42.719
And we all die.

01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:45.279
The whole invasion is a slaughter.

01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:47.359
Well, this is great.

01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:49.879
Really good confidence
boost for tomorrow. Thanks.

01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:51.719
But we can change it, right?

01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:53.679
There has to be something
that we can do.

01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:56.628
There has to be a way
that we can win.

01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:00.944
There is a chance. It's a slim one.

01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:04.519
But it means coming
with me right now.

01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:05.639
Listen, pal.

01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:08.879
I don't really care what you
think you know about us.

01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:11.225
We just met you.

01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:14.181
Why follow him into combat?

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.439
I don't expect you to follow me.

01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:24.183
I expect you to follow her.

01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:29.984
- That's the Full Metal Bitch.
- J Squad.

01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:32.879
This is Rita Vrataski.

01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:35.719
- Otherwise known as...
- Yeah, yeah.

01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:38.588
The Angel of Verdun.

01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:50.181
Okay.

01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:00.519
It's a new day, people.

01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:02.199
Destiny calls.

01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:05.719
The world expects only one
thing from us: that we will win.

01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:09.559
Rest assured the enemy will thank you
for not giving 100 percent today.

01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:11.188
Squad?

01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:16.066
Where's J Squad?

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:37.159
Right, okay. So this
Omega, it controls time.

01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:39.799
Just blow the New Age bollocks
back where it came from.

01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:41.319
And then we go home.

01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:44.159
- Right, it's guarded by an Alpha.
- Just kill it.

01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:45.239
Okay?

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:46.239
No!

01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:47.879
You heard what Cage said.

01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:49.479
Do not kill an Alpha.

01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:52.508
If we do, the Omega will
reset this whole day.

01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:54.519
We'll never remember we
had this conversation.

01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:56.599
They're gonna know we're coming.

01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:59.319
What am I supposed to do if
an Alpha is about to kill me?

01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:01.904
You take a hit for the team.

01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:06.199
When we're on the ground...

01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:09.865
there's not gonna be a lot of time
before they know we're there.

01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:12.231
We're gonna need eyes up here.

01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:15.905
I'm going in, Cage.

01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:29.430
Thirty seconds till contact.

01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:44.783
Cage!

01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:47.465
Kimmel! No!

01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:56.479
Ford!

01:29:56.480 --> 01:29:57.319
Let's go!

01:29:57.320 --> 01:29:58.709
Cage!

01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:00.159
Talk to me, Rita! We gotta go.

01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:01.079
Drop.

01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:02.999
Cage, they know we're coming, man!

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.039
Drop! Drop!

01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:06.907
Drop!

01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:08.719
Drop.

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:10.701
You're not hooked in.

01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:30.785
What took you so long?

01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:34.871
Any others?

01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:40.359
We're low on ammo.

01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:43.359
I've got one Claymore.
Ford, you're out.

01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:46.279
Griff has only got half a
magazine and he can hardly move.

01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:48.319
I thought you could see the future.

01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:50.585
I haven't lived this day.

01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:52.799
I don't know what's gonna happen.

01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:54.359
It doesn't matter.

01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:56.639
What matters is we finish this.

01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:58.746
With What?

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:01.999
I mean, Griff can't even walk.
We're three men down.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.639
- Come on.
- We're running out of time.

01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:05.599
Collect your ammo.

01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:08.199
Must be a thousand mimics
between us and the pyramid.

01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:10.479
What we gonna do?
Walk up to the front door?

01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:13.239
- If we stay here, we die.
- Yeah?

01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:15.159
We'll never get through.

01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:17.141
We could.

01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:19.981
In that.

01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:23.759
That ship will never fly.

01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:25.919
Doesn't need to fly.

01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:29.439
It just needs to get us
across there with speed.

01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:34.390
If the engines are still running, we
could steer it with the power levers.

01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:38.501
Skinner. Clear a path.

01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:45.479
- Try it again, now.
- No, it's not reading.

01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:47.188
Condition lever, low.

01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:55.591
Master power, on.

01:33:57.960 --> 01:33:59.861
Griff!

01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:02.948
We've gotta go! Come on!

01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:07.742
I'm not gonna be any
good in there, mate.

01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:10.430
Let me buy you some time.

01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:16.222
Power's on.

01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:18.399
This is gonna work.

01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:20.119
Hey!

01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:22.439
Hey, come on, man! We gotta go!

01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:24.199
Don't wait for us!

01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:25.199
Skinner!

01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:27.519
Griff, come on!

01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:30.679
- We're good to go. Where are they?
- Where's Skinner and Griff?

01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:32.786
They're not coming.

01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:48.467
Go, brother. You gotta go, man.

01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:51.145
I'll see you in the next life.

01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:56.986
Bollocks.

01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:01.031
Move over! Move over!

01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:04.199
We gotta go!

01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:06.226
Yo, we gotta go now!

01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:11.624
They're coming, Cage.

01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:21.519
Come on, you bastards! Come on!

01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:22.879
<i>Reload.</i>

01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:25.464
<i>Reload. Reload.</i>

01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:39.750
We got incoming!

01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:49.707
Come on!

01:35:57.120 --> 01:35:59.351
Cage!

01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:12.070
You have to take over!

01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:05.383
Rita!

01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:09.059
Punch it! Punch it!

01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:49.100
We've been through worse.

01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:29.182
Okay.

01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:32.461
It's there.

01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:34.741
In the water. There.

01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:03.319
That's an Alpha.

01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:07.064
I'm gonna draw that thing away.

01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:08.639
You kill the Omega.

01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:13.359
No. You won't make it 10 feet
before that thing kills you, Cage.

01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:14.999
- I can do it.
- Take the grenades.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.159
I can do it.

01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:19.719
Listen to me. Listen to me.

01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:23.226
Neither one of us is
getting out of here.

01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:47.591
Thank you...

01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:50.503
for getting me this far.

01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:57.464
You're a good man, Cage.

01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:01.348
I wish I had the chance
to know you better.

01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:32.719
Welcome to London, major.

01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:37.319
I'm Corporal Montgomery your liaison
to General Brigham's press office.

01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:39.585
Very good to have you.

01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:43.546
Have you heard the news?
Isn't it brilliant?

01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:53.399
<i>Just before sunrise this morning...</i>

01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:57.239
<i>a large surge of energy
was detected in Paris.</i>

01:43:57.240 --> 01:44:00.279
<i>We do not know exactly
what this signifies.</i>

01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:05.830
<i>But the result appears to be a total
collapse of the enemy's capacity to fight.</i>

01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:11.105
<i>Russian and Chinese troops are now
moving across Europe without resistance.</i>

01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:15.199
<i>Tomorrow, we advance
on the western front.</i>

01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:19.679
<i>We believe we are marching to
claim victory for ourselves...</i>

01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:24.599
<i>for our loved ones, for our
countrymen for the entire human race.</i>

01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:27.199
- What are you? Sound off!
- I'm a warrior!

01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:28.919
- What do warriors do?
- Kill!

01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:30.799
- What are you gonna do?
- Kill!

01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:33.439
- You have not been in 20 battles.
- I have too.

01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:35.959
You're gonna dump your load
the second you hit the beach.

01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:39.639
How about you two go get yourselves
a nice hot cup of shut-the-hell-up!

01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:40.799
Ha-ha. You funny, girl.

01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:43.159
I bet you I set some
kind of record tomorrow.

01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:47.079
Fastest time running backwards,
Ford, slipping in your own shit.

01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:49.709
Knock off the grab-ass!

01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:52.839
- What are you? Sound off!
- I'm a warrior!

01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:55.822
- What do warriors do?
- Kill!

01:44:57.200 --> 01:44:59.340
Attention!

01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:40.439
Yes?

01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:42.387
What do you want?
